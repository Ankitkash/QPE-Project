# Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) Project

This project demonstrated the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm using Qiskit, simulated in a Jupyter notebook. QPE is a fundamental quantum algorithm used to estimate the eigenvalues (phases) of unitary operators, which has applications in quantum computing like factoring and simulating quantum systems.

## Project Overview

- **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE):** This algorithm estimates the phase (or eigenvalue) of a given unitary operator with respect to a specific eigenvector.
- **Simulation in Qiskit:** All simulations are performed using IBM's open-source quantum computing framework, Qiskit, in a Jupyter notebook environment.
